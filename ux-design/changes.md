Pharmaceutical company’s Medical Science Liaison product 

Problem: 
Develop a responsive web application that helps MSLs (Medical Science Liaisons) manage a list of Doctor accounts, manage (select, annotate, share, etc) a large set of documentation, and schedule, conduct, and capture output from meetings with Doctors.

This must support the MSL’s main goal of opening and maintaining an ongoing conversation with Doctors to share information and answer questions. MSLs (Medical Science Liaisons) are field representatives who meet with Doctors to gather information about how products (drugs, drug therapies and protocols) are being used and to answer any questions that Doctors might have. 

This project was a contract limited to just 4 weeks. My goal was to get as much completed as I could so that I could provide value at four weeks, and to show enough value that the contract would be extended. 

I followed a general lifecycle process that I use, with variations, on most projects: 
Make an initial plan
Understand the problem
Develop concepts (quickly, iteratively) to see what might stick and test my understanding of the problem 
Detailed design: architecture, interaction, then visual
Develop, test, iterate.

Many of these steps can take place in parallel and iteratively.

Establish a plan: 
I first created a plan - very rough, with lots of checkpoints. At my first meeting with the cross-functional team, I shared the plan.

Research: 
I wanted to make sure I understood the problem. I reviewed what the project team had already assembled - presentations, notes. 
I interviewed members of the project team and members of the IT group that maintained the document library
I interviewed MSLs about their work. (I wanted to shadow, but was unable to in the time frame).

Synthesis:
I created a journey map that followed an MSL through a typical encounter and I pulled together findings in an informal report. An example of a key finding: No MSLs followed the prescribed method because it was unsuited to the field. If we built the software the way the team thought it should be built, the MSLs would just have to work around it the way they currently were doing.

Concepts: 
I started concepts - whiteboard sketches and simple wireframes and interaction models in Sketch as I was doing discovery. I shared these materials with the team to get feedback, maintain transparency, continue the conversation. I used what I learned from these exchanges to continue to modify, improve, or abandon various concepts. 

The combination of journey maps and sketches and the conversations showed that what the team thought were viable options were unnecessary and that there was a better alternative. 

Design: 

As the team began to narrow concepts, I started wireframing - more detailed concepts and mockups that I could. At this point, I also mocked up some very rough visual representations to give the development team an idea of how to apply corporate style. 

Conclusion: 

The result was, with a 2 week extension, a project team with a more robust understanding of the user’s goals, an interaction model and key wireframes to describe best solution, journey maps to help compare various workflows and experiences, and mockups of key screens. 

Although I was unable to continue the work, the project team was able to show stakeholders the result and to get approval to proceed with the project.
